# Diabetes-Check Demo Script

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Welcome to Diabetes-Check, a web application that helps identify potential Type 2 Diabetes risk from medical reports using machine learning. Let me show you how it works."

## User Registration (20 seconds)
"First, let's create a new account. I'll enter my email and password. The system uses secure JWT authentication to protect user data."

## Medical Report Upload (30 seconds)
"Now, I'll upload a sample medical report. The application supports both PDF and image formats. The system will automatically extract relevant clinical features using OCR technology."

## Feature Extraction (30 seconds)
"Let's look at how the system processes the report. It extracts key clinical markers like glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure. These features are validated to ensure accuracy."

## Risk Prediction (30 seconds)
"The XGBoost model analyzes these features to predict diabetes risk. Here we can see the probability score and a confidence level. The model has been trained on clinical data to provide accurate predictions."

## SHAP Analysis (30 seconds)
"One of the most important aspects is understanding why the model made this prediction. The SHAP plot shows us which features contributed most to the risk assessment. This helps both patients and healthcare providers understand the factors involved."

## User Interface (20 seconds)
"The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Users can easily upload reports, view their history, and track changes over time. The results are presented in a clear, understandable format."

## Conclusion (15 seconds)
"Diabetes-Check demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early diabetes detection. The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and can be extended with additional features as needed."

## Technical Highlights (20 seconds)
- Flask backend with REST API
- Streamlit frontend
- XGBoost model with SHAP interpretability
- Docker containerization
- OCR processing with pytesseract

## Future Developments (20 seconds)
"Future versions will include support for more medical report formats, integration with EMR systems, and enhanced model training with real-world data. We're also working on HIPAA compliance for clinical use."
